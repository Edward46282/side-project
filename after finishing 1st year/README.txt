My first side project is a 'menu picker'.

Have you ever had an experience where you can't decide what you want to eat and want somebody else to pick for you? In that case, my menu picker is the right choice!
It stores the list of menus and their main ingredients in the menu_list.txt file. You can always add or remove the specific menu from that file if you like.

********IMPORTANT********

You MUST follow the original format when you add the menu to the txt file.
The original format follows:
(menu name): (three main ingredients)

Also, it is important to keep three '#' between meal categories.

How to use it?

1. If you haved installed java, please install it (I used Java 17 to make this project. So, Java 17 is recommended).
2. Download the files from the GitHub and place it in the same folder (RandomPicker.java, MenuPicker.java, MenuReader.java, and menu_list.txt).
3. If you use Windows device, open terminal and put -> cd (directory of the file). For example, cd C:\Users\name\Downloads\side_project. side_project is the name of the folder in my case.
4. After you hit enter, put -> javac MenuPicker.java
5. After you hit enter, put -> java MenuPicker

Then, you should be in the main class. Then follow the instruction in the terminal to use it.
