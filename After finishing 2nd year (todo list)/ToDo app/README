My second side-project is "TO-DO List".

This is a To-Do List Android application built using Java and Android Studio.
It allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively by providing functionality to add, remove, edit, and list tasks. The application uses an SQL database to store the tasks.

Here is a demonstration video of the application.
